    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Austin. I live in southern Arizona with my wife of nearly four years and my two amazing kids as pictured.
        I have been a member of the church for nearly four years now, being baptized shortly after being married and laterly sealed.
        A few hobbies of mine include video games / technology as a whole, riding dirt bikes and four wheelers, and as of recently raising
        various animals with currently raising chickens, ducks, and quaail with the intention of setting up for goats in the next year. Im excited 
        to learn more about httml / css this semester and to meet you guys!
