                    <h2>The Denver Broncos</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Broncos are Historically one of the winningest teams to ever compete in the NFL. Since the stat started to be tracked in 1975, the Broncos have only had eleven losing seasons, they have 
                        won the division 15 times, been to eight Super Bowls, and have won three of them. Love them or hate them the Denver Broncos continue to be a staple and power house within the AFC and 
                        NFL as whole. While they seem to have lost steam since Peyton Manning retired after winning Super Bowl 50 with the team in 2016, they seem to have gained some of that momentum back late into this 2023 season.

                    <p>
                        As A member of the AFC West conference the Broncos so far have had a rollercoaster of a season. They started the season going only 1-5 with their only win coming from a close one
                        over the Chicago Bears in week 4. They also lost to the Miami Dolphins by a league record of 50 points, losing 70-20 in Miami in week 3. However, since the first six games the Broncos have 
                        gone on a five game winning streak beating highly ranked teams in back to back weeks, first beatring the Kansas City Chiefs in week eight 24-9 then beating the Buffalo Bills in week nine 24-22.

                        This is the second season with Russell Wilson as QB1 and the first season with Sean Payton as head coach. Most expected for this duo to dominate this season and while it looked hopeless at 
                        the beginning of the season, they seem to be on the same page now. The defense is also playing lights out in this five game win streak, having a League high fifteen takeaways in just the 
                        last four games! Let's go Broncos!!
