                        <p>
                            The most notable Broncos owner was Pat Bowlen, before then it passed from wealthy man to wealthy man, Pat was the first person to believe the Broncos could be a powerhouse of the NFL and was willing to put his money where his mouth was, he bought the Denver Broncos in 1984 
                            for $78 million. The Broncos had only been to one super bowl before Pat bought the team and went to seven more under his ownership and won three of those. Pat ran the team up until his death in June of 2019. In 2022 the Walton-Penner group bought the Broncos from the remaining 
                            Bowlen family for $4.65 billion making it at the time the most expensive team to ever be sold in pro sports history. In their short stint so far this group has brought in former Seattle Seahawks 
                            All-Pro quarterback Russell Wilson and former New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton and the possibility of getting back to greatness is looking good under this ownership.

                    <h2>Championships</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Broncos have been to some of the most Super Bowls in league history, but have only won three times. Their first win came in 1998 against the reigning Super Bowl champions the Green Bay Packers Where they won 24-10. They however wouldn't have to wait long before their next 
                        ring coming only the next season 1999 against the Atlanta Falcons where they won 34-19 and becoming just one of a handful of teams to win back to back championships in the NFL. Both of
                        those Super Bowls were led by Hall of Fame quarterback John Elway and running back Terrell Davis. Both earned Super Bowl MVP honors with Terrell Davis winning it in 1998 and John Elway in 1999. They would however have to wait another sixteen years before getting their third 
                        and most recent championship where they won in 2016 against the Carolina Panthers 24-10, they were led by  Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning and on defense Von Miller. Von Miller would go on to get Super Bowl MVP honors after being the star of the game.

                    <h2>Uniforms</h2>
                    <p>
                        Over many years the Broncos have sported many uniforms but nothing like they did in their first two seasons. In 1960 then general manager Dean Griffing used jerseys that could be worn for both home and away games to save on cost as the franchise started out, they were mustard 
                        yellow and brown. The Broncos would then in 1962 adopt the orange and blue uniforms with the horse logo, while the logo looked different than it does today it was headed in the right direction. These uniforms would only last six seasons before transitioning to the teams longest tenured 
                        uniform with the nostalgic big D logo, this is the uniform was the one most Bronco greats wore and what the Broncos wore for most of their championship appearances. However they went 0-5 in these uniforms and didn't win their first one until switching to the main blue uniforms in 
                        1998. They wore the blue uniform with orange now being an alternative until 2013 where they switched back to the orange being the main color. Over time they have added alternative helmets and jerseys to continue to honor the team they once were.
