                        <h2>Players</h2>
                        <p>
                            There have been many famous and notable players to have played for the Denver Broncos since their existence in 1960. However you will find no other more notable than John Elway. John Elway was drafted first round by the Broncos in 1983 where he would play his entire 
                            career and win two super bowls in 1998 and 1999 and taking the Broncos to a total of five Super Bowls in His time as the Broncos quarterback. Two other players that were vital in those two Super Bowl wins were tight end Shannon Sharpe and running back Terrell Davis, both who are 
                            inducted in the Hall of Fame. Terrell Davis was the MVP of the 1998 Super Bowl playing most of the second half with intense migraines and even at one point playing without being able to see but went in the game still to fool the defense into thinking the Broncos were going to run the ball. 
                            There are many other important players to have played for the Broncos including Peyton Manning, Von Miller, and Demarcus Ware. These three players all helped the Broncos to win 
                            their third Super Bowl in 2015 with Von Miller winning the honors of Super Bowl MVP. Other important players include the likes of Ed McCaffrey, John Lynch, Brian Dawkins, Champ Bailey, and others!

                    <h2>Coaches</h2>
                    <p>
                        Coaches Just like the Players there has been many great coaches for the Broncos. The most important one in my opinion being Mike Shanahan, Shanahan spent time in the early 90s as an assistant for the Broncos until in 1995 becoming the Head Coach. Shanahan spent from 1995 - 2008 as the Broncos Head coach and even held the position of vice president of football operations in the latter years of his time with the Broncos,
                        Shanahan won both Super Bowl 1998 and 1999 with the Broncos but would be let go in 2008 after putting up a disappointing 8-8 season and missing the playoffs. Gary Kubiak is another important coach for the Broncos after spending some time with Broncos in the late 90s and winning Super Bowl 1998 and 1999 with head coach Shanahan, Kubiak would go on to have a semi productive career being the head coach through
                        multiple teams most notably the Houston Texans before returning to the Broncos in 2015 as the head coach. Kubiak had a short time being back with the Broncos suffering medical issues that made him leave the team as a head coach in 2016 but not before winning his own Super Bowl as a
                        head coach in 2016. He would then play a vital role for the team as a senior personal advisor for another two seasons. With our current head Coach Sean Payton, we hope to see more of that winning way going forward.

                        This one particular fan became a staple for Broncos fans both close and far, in person and on tv. Tim Mckernan or known as “Barrel Man” showed up to Broncos home games dressed in a barrel with Broncos logo all over and no shirt starting in 1977. He is what most would call a 
                        super fan and there are many like him Chief Zee for the Washington Commanders, Crazy Ray for the Dallas Cowboys, or License Plate Guy for the New York Giants. Regardless of the team or the sport your team has probably had one of these super fans. Barrel Man became so 
                        popular that he was put into many of the NFL video games, was honored when he passed in 2009 by the Denver Broncos, and even has his own statue at the Broncos Stadium. While Not everyone can be as a standout fan like Barrell man we all can still be huge supporters of our 
                        favorite teams especially if it's the Denver Broncos. From having our own game day traditions or superstitions, get out there and support one of the best teams to step onto the gridiron!
