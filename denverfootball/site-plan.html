      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Championships
        The Broncos have been to some of the most Super Bowls in league history, but have only won three times. Their first win came in 1998 against the reigning Super Bowl champions the Green
        Bay Packers Where they won 24-10. They however wouldn't have to wait long before their next ring coming only the next season 1999 against the Atlanta Falcons where they won 34-19 and becoming just one of a handful of teams to win back to back championships in the NFL. Both of 
        those Super Bowls were led by Hall of Fame quarterback John Elway and running back Terrell Davis. Both earned Super Bowl MVP honors with Terrell Davis winning it in 1998 and John Elway in 1999. They would however have to wait another sixteen years before getting their third
        and most recent championship where they won in 2016 against the Carolina Panthers 24-10, they were led by  Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning and on defense Von Miller. Von Miller would go on to get Super Bowl MVP honors after being the star of the game.
      <p> 
        Uniforms 
        Over many years the Broncos have sported many uniforms but nothing like they did in their first two seasons. In 1960 then general manager Dean Griffing used jerseys that could be worn for both home and away games to save on cost as the franchise started out, they were mustard 
        yellow and brown. The Broncos would then in 1962 adopt the orange and blue uniforms with the horse logo, while the logo looked different than it does today it was headed in the right direction. These uniforms would only last six seasons before transitioning to the teams longest tenured 
        uniform with the nostalgic big D logo, this is the uniform was the one most Bronco greats wore and what the Broncos wore for most of their championship appearances. However they went 0-5 in these uniforms and didn't win their first one until switching to the main blue uniforms in 
        1998. They wore the blue uniform with orange now being an alternative until 2013 where they switched back to the orange being the main color. Over time they have added alternative helmets and jerseys to continue to honor the team they once were. 
      <p>
      <p>
        Owners
        The most notable Broncos owner was Pat Bowlen, before then it passed from wealthy man to wealthy man, Pat was the first person to believe the Broncos could be a powerhouse of the NFL and was willing to put his money where his mouth was, he bought the Denver Broncos in 1984
        for $78 million. The Broncos had only been to one super bowl before Pat bought the team and went to seven more under his ownership and won three of those. Pat ran the team up until his death in June of 2019. In 2022 the Walton-Penner group bought the Broncos from the remaining
        Bowlen family for $4.65 billion making it at the time the most expensive team to ever be sold in pro sports history. In their short stint so far this group has brought in former Seattle Seahawks 
        All-Pro quarterback Russell Wilson and former New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton and the possibility of getting back to greatness is looking good under this ownership.

      <h3>People</h3>
      <p>
        players 
        Over the years the Broncos have had many notable players that have contributed to some of the most successful seasons of the franchise history but none have been as successful as Hall of Famer and ex general manager of the Broncos, John Elway. Elway attended Stanford where 
        he studied and played football from 1979 - 1982 before being selected by the Broncos in the 1983 draft, this didn't go without its fair share of issues however. John Elway coming out of college wanted to be in a big market team so when the then Baltimore Colts announced they 
        were going to pick Elway in the 1983 draft Elway had threatened to go play professional baseball instead. It wasn't until the Colts backed down and opened the door for another team to trade up in the draft and pick Elway that the Broncos would find their franchise quarterback
        going to five Super Bowls and winning two with Elway. The third Super Bowl was won with Peyton Manning, former Indianapolis Colts Quarterback who was released from the Colts in 2012 after sustaining two neck injuries with the Colts, the Broncos would end up signing him
        and going to two more Super bowls, winning one and losing one. Some other worthwhile players to learn more about would be Von Miller, Champ Bailey, Terrell Davis, Shannon Sharp, Ed McCaffrey, John Lynch, Brian Dawkins, and others!
      <p>
        Coaches
        Just like the Players there has been many great coaches for the Broncos. The most important one in my opinion being Mike Shanahan, Shanahan spent time in the early 90s as an assistant for the Broncos until in 1995 becoming the Head Coach. Shanahan spent from 1995 - 2008 as
        the Broncos Head coach and even held the position of vice president of football operations in the latter years of his time with the Broncos, Shanahan one both Super Bowl 1998 and 1999 with the Broncos but would be let go in 2008 after putting up a disappointing 8-8 season and 
        missing the playoffs. Gary Kubiak is another important coach for the Broncos after spending some time with Broncos in the late 90s and winning Super Bowl 1998 and 1999 with head coach Shanahan, Kubiak would go on to have a semi productive career being the head coach through
        multiple teams most notably the Houston Texans before returning to the Broncos in 2015 as the head coach. Kubiak had a short time being back with the Broncos suffering medical issues that made him leave the team as a head coach in 2016 but not before winning his own Super Bowl
        as a head coach in 2016. He would then play a vital role for the team as a senior personal advisor for another two seasons. With our current head Coach Sean Payton, we hope to see more of that winning way going forward.
      </p>
      Other 
      This one particular fan became a staple for Broncos fans both close and far, in person and on tv. Tim Mckernan or known as “Barrel Man” showed up to Broncos home games dressed in a barrel with Broncos logo all over and no shirt starting in 1977. He is what most would call a 
      super fan and there are many like him Chief Zee for the Washington Commanders, Crazy Ray for the Dallas Cowboys, or License Plate Guy for the New York Giants. Regardless of the team or the sport your team has probably had one of these super fans. Barrel Man became so 
      popular that he was put into many of the NFL video games, was honored when he passed in 2009 by the Denver Broncos, and even has his own statue at the Broncos Stadium.
